AIC Project Changelog
=============================

At the Digital Experience department of the Art Institute of Chicago, we use Redmine as our
internal issue tracker. Some of the changes listed here reference issues tracked via Redmine.
In order to differentiate between references to GitHub issues and Redmine issues, we are
adopting the following scheme:

```
* Change description (#14) [#23]

(#14) = reference to a GitHub issue
[#23] = reference to a Redmine issue
```

Outside contributors can ignore Redmine references.
